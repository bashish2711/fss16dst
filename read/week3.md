Bug Report Retrieval. In Proceedings of ICSE '10 Proceedings of the 32nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering - Volume 1.
## **Keywords**
1.	**Duplicate/Master bug reports:** In large projects when a bug manifests end-user/testers can submit bug reports. However, multiple reports from different submitters may correspond to the same bug report. In this situation the first report of the bug is termed a Master and the later reported instances of the same bug as duplicates.
2.	**Triager:** A person who maintains manual labelling for bug reports as duplicates, and links them to their "master" report for subsequent maintenance work.
3.	**Discriminative model:** Unlike previous approaches that rank similar bug reports based on similarity score of vector space representation,we develop a discriminative model to retrieve similar bug reports from a bug repository. Authors make use of the recent advances in information retrieval community that uses a classifier to retrieve similar documents from a collection. We build a model that contrasts duplicate bug reports from non-duplicate bug reports and utilize this model to extract similar bug reports, given a query bug report under consideration.
