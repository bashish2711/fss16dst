Read chapters one to four of [Think like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html)

+ 10. Lists
+ 11. Dictionaries
+ 12. Tuples
+ 15. Classes and Objects
+ 16. Classes and Functions
+ 17. Classes and Methods
+ 18. Inheritance

Read about Python's [magic methods](http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html)

Then do:

+ 10.15 Exercise 8 (the Birthday Paradox)
+ Write an `Employeee` class
     + That can be initialized with name and age (hint: `__init__`)
     + That pretty prints name and age (hint: `__repr__`)
	 + That can be sorted on age (hint: `__lt__`)
+ 18.12:Exercise 6 (Poker!) 

## Outputs
