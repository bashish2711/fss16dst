# Homework4: Your First Optimizer


# Basic Simulated Annealing

Read the [lecture](talk3sa.md) on simulated annealing.

Hack up a simulated annealer for the
[Schaffer](pdf/moeaProblems.pdf) model.

- Do not be clever. This is throw away code. As quick
and as dirty as you like.
- Feel free to hardwire Schaffer into your code.
